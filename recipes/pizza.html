    <p>
        Homemade pizza is a classic favorite that's easy to make and allows for endless customization. Start with a
        fresh pizza dough, spread a rich tomato sauce, and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Add your choice of toppings,
        whether it's pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, or olives. A pinch of oregano and basil adds that perfect
        Italian touch. Bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Serve hot and savor the delicious,
        cheesy, and aromatic flavors of a perfect homemade pizza!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the pizza dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110째F or 45째C)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce or pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice, such as pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, sliced mushrooms, black olives, and sliced
            onions</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, for a little heat)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine warm water, active dry yeast, and sugar. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10
            minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and salt to the yeast mixture.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the all-purpose flour and mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise for about 1-2 hours until it
            doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two portions for two medium-sized pizzas or leave it whole for
            one large pizza.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet that's dusted with cornmeal or
            flour. This will make it easier to transfer the pizza to the oven.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of tomato sauce or pizza sauce over the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of pizza toppings, such as pepperoni, vegetables, and any other ingredients you like.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle dried oregano and basil over the toppings. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like it spicy.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven or place the baking sheet in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly and slightly
            browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice your homemade pizza, serve it, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
