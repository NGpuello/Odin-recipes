        Description
    </h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish that's both comforting and delicious. It consists of layers of wide,
        flat pasta noodles, rich meat sauce (ragù), creamy béchamel sauce, and a generous amount of cheese, typically
        mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan. The layers are stacked one on top of the other, creating a hearty and
        satisfying dish. The lasagna is then baked until the noodles are tender, and the cheese is golden and bubbly.
        The result is a mouthwatering, savory casserole that's a perfect harmony of flavors and textures. It's a
        favorite for gatherings and family dinners, sure to leave everyone coming back for seconds!

    <h3>
        Preparation
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g of lean beef mince in two batches for about 10
            minutes until browned all over.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour over 800g of passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml of hot beef stock. Add a little
            grated nutmeg, then season.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 minutes until the sauce looks rich.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack.
            Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you
            cant see any pasta poking through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 45 minutes until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
        </li>
    </ol>
